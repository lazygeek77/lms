# Neighborhood Library Service – Take-Home Test

## Overview
A small neighborhood library wants a new App to manage its members, books, and lending operations. You must build this service using:

● Python for the server implementation
● REST or gRPC with Protocol Buffers for the service interface
● PostgreSQL as the data store

## Functional Requirements
The library needs to track:
- Books (title, author, etc.)
- Members (name, contact info, etc.)
- Borrowing/Returning operations (who borrowed what, when, etc.)

At a minimum, your App should allow the library staff to:
1. Create/Update records for books and members.
2. Record when a member borrows a book.
3. Record when a borrowed book is returned.
4. Query or list borrowed books in some fashion (e.g., all books a certain member has out).
You may include more functionality if you see fit (e.g., handling overdue books, tracking fines, due dates, etc.), but the above points are the core requirements.

## Your Task
1. Design the Database Schema
● Decide on the tables/entities you’ll need, how they relate, and what fields/columns belong in each.
● You’ll store this data in PostgreSQL.
2. Define the gRPC-Web Service(use REST if you are not comfortable with gRPC web)
● Create one or more .proto files with the necessary Protobuf message types and service definitions.
● Determine which RPC methods (and their request/response messages) are needed to support the core library operations.
3. Implement the Python gRPC or REST API Server
● Write Python code to spin up an API server.
● In each API method, interact with your PostgreSQL database (create/read/update records, etc.).
4. Documentation/Delivery
● Provide a short README detailing how to:
● Set up the database (scripts or Docker instructions, etc.).
● Generate or compile the .proto files (if needed).
● Run the Python server (command-line steps, required libraries, environment variables).
● Include any necessary files or folders so another developer can easily build, run, and test your service.

## Minimal Frontend
● Provide web frontend by using React (next.js preferably).

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Schema Design
● Clarity, normalization, and use of relationships in PostgreSQL.
2. Service Interface
● How intuitive and well-structured your REST / gRPC endpoints and Protobuf messages are.
3. Code Quality
● Organization, readability, and maintainability of your code.
4. Documentation
● Ease of setup and clear explanation of how to test the service.
Tip (Optional)
● Consider adding error handling for cases like trying to borrow a book that’s already checked out.
● Implementing validation (e.g., ensuring valid inputs for new records).
● Show how a client might call your service (e.g., providing a sample script).
